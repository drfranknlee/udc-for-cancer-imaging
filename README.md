# Unified Data Catalog for Cancer Imaging


Spectrum Discover, the IBM enterprise metadata platform, is used to ingest, index, create and enrich metadata of a cancer imaging dataset, thus enabling data scientists and biomedical researchers to better organize and access data. 

Spend less time finding & copying, have more time discovering.

The Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification (BreakHis) is composed of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X).  To date, it contains 2,480  benign and 5,429 malignant samples (700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8-bit depth in each channel, PNG format). This database has been built in collaboration with the P&D Laboratory  – Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology, Parana, Brazil (http://www.prevencaoediagnose.com.br).
